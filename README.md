# Concrete Strength Prediction using Neural Network

This repository contains a Python script for predicting the compressive strength of concrete using a neural network. The script utilizes the Keras library with a TensorFlow backend for model development.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can install them using the following command:

## Load the Dataset:

Replace the file path in the script with the actual path to your dataset.
## Usage

### Load the Dataset:

Replace the file path in the script with the actual path to your dataset.

### Explore the Dataset:

Use the `head()` function to display the first few rows of the dataset.

### Data Preparation:

Separate the features (input) and target (output) variables.

Split the data into training and testing sets (70% training, 30% testing).

Standardize the input features (optional but recommended for neural networks).

### Build the Neural Network Model:

Define and configure the neural network architecture.

### Compile and Train the Model:

Compile the model with an optimizer and loss function.

Train the model for 50 epochs.

### Evaluate the Model:

Predict concrete strength on the test data.

Calculate the mean squared error for each prediction.

Report the mean and standard deviation of mean squared errors.

## Note

Adjust the hyperparameters, such as the number of nodes in the hidden layer, the optimizer, and the number of epochs, to optimize the model's performance for your specific dataset.
